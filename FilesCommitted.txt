Since I commmited to Github in one monster commit it is hard to tell what files I changed. This doc will include the files added or modified.

NOTE: I had some issues with Github so the repo on github is named books-api-rails. However you may see the remote repo as myTest. I think changed it.

Files Added, Modified
---------------------

1) db/seeds.rb

Populated database with fake data using Faker gem

2) config/routes.rb

Defined routes for Book resource

3) db/schema.rb

Generated by model creation. Did not touch. 

4) db/migrate/20180804195216_create_books.rb

Generated by data model creation

5) models/book.rb

Created by data model creation. Modified with model validation of attributes

6) controller/api/v1/books_controller.rb

Generated by controller creation. Modified to add the index, show, update, and destroy methods

7) Gemfile

Modified to add Faker gem for development usage of creating test data in database

8) db/development.sqlite3

Database file that contains sql lite database. Looks like this is not commit since binary file. I assume can be generated from migration file.


There are probably some other generated files when running the rails command that were created that I did not touch.
